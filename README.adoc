= VertxOtelStarter


This application was generated using http://start.vertx.io

== Build and Run

Run the BaseMain.java from an IDE

Execute 
```
curl --location 'http://localhost:8888/api'
```

The handler for the request will return immediately but it has a logger in vertx.setTimer().
We can see the TraceId/ Context is absent in the logger (enclosed in setTimer).

The traceId/ Context will be present if we change the vertx version in the pom to 4.4.x or 4.3.x
